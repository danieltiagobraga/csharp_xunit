 Unit Testing with xUnit.net

Asserts

Asserts evaluate and verify the outcome of a test, based on a returned result, final object state, or the occurrence of events observed during execution. An assert can either pass or fail. If all asserts pass, the test passes; if any assert fails the test fails. xUnit.Net provides a wide range of assert functionality for different types of results.
